# ORION CROSS-CHECK AI (work in progress)
Multi-Model LLM Benchmarking System

This project aims to test and compare different Large Language Models (LLMs) on space physics questions in order to evaluate their accuracy, consistency, and performance.  

## Compared Models
- GPT-4 (provider: OpenAI)  
- Claude 3 Sonnet (provider: Anthropic)  
- Coming soon: a third LLM acting as a "judge" to evaluate and score the answers.  

## Tested Domain
The benchmark focuses on space physics, including:  
- Orbital mechanics: escape velocity, Hohmann transfer, apogee/perigee, orbital period.  
- Space propulsion: Oberth effect, ion propulsion.  
- Celestial mechanics: tidal locking, Lagrange points.  

## Example Questions
1. What is the escape velocity of an object from the surface of Mars?  
2. How do you calculate a Hohmann transfer orbit between Earth and Mars?  
3. Explain the Oberth effect and how it is used in space propulsion.  
4. What is the difference between apogee and perigee in an elliptical orbit?  
5. How does ion propulsion work in space and what are its advantages?  
6. Calculate the orbital period of a satellite at 400 km altitude above Earth.  
7. What causes tidal locking and how does it affect planetary moons?  
8. Explain the concept of Lagrange points and their applications.  

## Goal
The benchmark compares the ability of LLMs to:  
- Introduce the correct physical concepts.  
- Provide the relevant formulas and expected values.  
- Explain clearly and coherently.
